As \cite{westin_legal_1967} predicted in his \textit{``Legal Safeguards to Insure Privacy in a Computer Society''}, the rapid development of data surveillance technology overpowered the individual right to privacy in favour of business profit.
His postulates on privacy, written before the inventions of the internet and the Web, influenced the privacy regulations enacted in the following decades and its impact can still be seen in the European Union's (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), through its \textit{actionable} data subject rights, which intend to give individuals the freedom to control their own personal information~\citep{westin_privacy_1967}.
Throughout his career, from 1990 to 2003, Westin also conducted a series of surveys related to consumer attitudes towards privacy, where a majority of consumers reported having \textit{``lost all control over how personal information about them is circulated and used by companies''}~\citep{kumaraguru_privacy_2005}.
Additionally, these surveys highlighted the variety of individual concerns about privacy -- the~\citeyear{westin_equifax-harris_1996}'s study showed that 25\% of the public are fundamentalists (people who are highly concerned with their privacy), 59\% pragmatists (people who are concerned with their privacy and want to protect themselves from the abuse or misuse of their personal information by companies or government agencies) and 16\% unconcerned (people who have no real concerns about privacy) and a similar study in 2003~\citep{taylor_most_2003} showed an increase in the percentage of pragmatists, 64\%, and a decrease in the unconcerned, 10\% -- a powerful reminder that, while there are more people with real concerns about the misuse of their data, different people want to have a different level of control over their privacy settings.

Following Westin's postulates, Convention 108~\citep{council_of_europe_convention_1981} was created as the first and only international data protection instrument, and over the years, enhancements have been made to address automated data processing, and trans-jurisdictional data flows.
Furthermore, in Europe, the first data protection law, the Data Protection Directive, was introduced in~\citeyear{noauthor_directive_1995} and the Charter of Fundamental Rights acknowledged the \textit{``right to the protection of personal data''} in~\citeyear{noauthor_charter_2000}.
This last one was revised and expanded in 2016 to deal with the intensive usage of digital personal data, in the form of the GDPR~\citeyearpar{noauthor_regulation_2016}.
Building on this, in 2020, and after widespread adoption of GDPR-like data protection regulations around the world~\citep{bradford_brussels_2019}, the European Commission launched its \textit{strategy for data}~\citep{european_commission_communication_2020}, with the goal of allowing the cross-sector flow of data within the EU, while ensuring that the \textit{``European rules and values, in particular personal data protection, consumer protection legislation and competition law, are fully respected''}.
Since then, we have seen the launch of a series of proposals for regulation by the European Commission and Parliament, some of them already approved and being enforced, that build on the GDPR when it comes to the processing of personal data, with the main purpose of promoting the EU's data economy while better placing EU's citizens in control of what happens to their data.
In parallel, technological development with similar goals of empowering data subjects through increased retention and control over their data has grown, however these two strands have not been well integrated to date.
