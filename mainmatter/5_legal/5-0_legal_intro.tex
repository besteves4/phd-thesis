This Chapter discusses the legal and ethical challenges of the impact of data-driven innovation in society, in particular, related to the emergence of PIMS as a service that helps individuals have more control over the processing of their data.
While some studies have recently been published on the intersection of Solid and data protection requirements, as reviewed in Section~\ref{sec:sota_solid_data_protection}, plenty still has to be overcome to have a `legally-aligned' personal datastore.
This interdisciplinary discussion relies on the collaborations fostered through the PROTECT project and other EU-funded projects, described in Section~\ref{sec:projects}, as well as through the participation in the W3C DPVCG work with data protection law experts.

Section \ref{sec:motivation_legal} describes the emergence of decentralised personal information management systems as a way to give users more control over their personal data and the challenges that still need to be overcome in order to have to a GDPR-aligned personal datastore.
% Such policies will be used to express the data subjects' preferences concerning the access to their \textit{personal} data, to represent requests to access data and to record the agreed access conditions for future inspection.

% Section \ref{sec:plasma} describes the development of a metadata language for Solid (PLASMA) to provide consistent taxonomies to describe the entities, infrastructure, policies, notices, registries and logs necessary to understand and establish responsibilities and accountability within the Solid ecosystem.
% PLASMA utilises OAC to express data policies, provides a set of conformance conditions that should be met by Pod, app, and service providers, as well as users and agents, to comply with the established specification, and a description of workflows where PLASMA terms should be used to satisfy such conformance conditions.

% Section \ref{sec:rights_exercising} showcases the usage of vocabulary-based, e.g. DPV, DCMI, PROV-O and DCAT, patterns to describe rights exercising metadata with the goal of providing uniform records of data subject rights exercising activities.

% Section \ref{sec:evaluation} presents the results of the ontologies quality evaluation, including the detection of common pitfalls with OOPS!, alignment with FAIR principles with FOOPS! and validation of competency questions with SPARQL queries.

% The methodology followed to develop and evaluate the vocabularies described in this Chapter is described in Section \ref{sec:ontology_engineering}.
