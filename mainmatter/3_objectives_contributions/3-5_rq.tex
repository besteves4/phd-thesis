\section{Research questions}
\label{sec:rqs}

The main research question that supports this Thesis is:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=royallavender!20]
To what extent are Semantic Web vocabularies and decentralised technologies able to support the exercising of data subject rights and determine the access conditions to personal data?
\end{tcolorbox}

We divide the main research question into the following sub-questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item [\textbf{RQ1.}] Are Semantic Web standards and specifications able to represent information related to privacy preferences, data access policies, and other metadata, aligned with personal data protection requirements?
    \item [\textbf{RQ2.}] Can Semantic Web vocabularies be used to determine access control conditions to personal data stored in decentralised data systems?
    \item [\textbf{RQ3.}] Is it possible, using decentralised Web technologies, to facilitate the exercising of data subject rights in light of the GDPR?
\end{enumerate}
