\section{Restrictions}
\label{sec:restrictions}

The work presented in this Thesis is subject to the following restrictions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item [\textbf{R1.}] The scope of the research will be restricted to decentralised datastores based on the technology stack of the Semantic Web.
    \item [\textbf{R2.}] The research in this Thesis is focused on the personal data protection domain in the European Union as it presents a fully-fledged legal regime, the GDPR, which puts the data subjects at the centre of the flow of their personal data.
    \item [\textbf{R3.}] The legal analysis does not contemplate the Data Protection Law Enforcement Directive 2016/680, which was launched together with the GDPR.
    \item [\textbf{R4.}] The research in this Thesis is restricted to personal data that is digitally available in an open format, e.g. RDF, CSV, or PNG files.
    \item [\textbf{R5.}] The research in this Thesis focuses on determining access control to decentralised data -- usage control, i.e., what happens to the data once it has been accessed, is out of the scope. %DL: this is reasonable, but does that need a discussion then on the implication for claim contributions and further work, eg are gdpr projections sufficient to ensure the improved control offered to subjects is not eroded once commercial controllers have a copy of the data?
