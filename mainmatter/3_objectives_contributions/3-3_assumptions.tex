\section{Assumptions}
\label{sec:assumptions}

The work presented in this Thesis is done under the following set of assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item [\textbf{A1.}] Decentralised personal datastores function as a personal information management system and as such should be regulated according to personal data processing law, whereas broader datastores can be used for storing all types of data and therefore imply a myriad of additional legislation, which is not in the scope of this research.
    \item [\textbf{A2.}] It is viable and advantageous for users to manage their data and privacy preferences through decentralised services and applications.
\end{enumerate}
