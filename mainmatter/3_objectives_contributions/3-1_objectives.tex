\label{sec:objectives}

To address the challenges and limitations identified in Section \ref{sec:challenges}, the main objective of this Thesis is the following:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=royallavender!20]
Research methodologies and design vocabularies and services to aid EU data subjects in taking control of the movement of their personal data.
\end{tcolorbox}

This main objective is divided into the following three sub-objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item [\textbf{O1.}] Design methods and systems to assist data subjects (in representing their privacy preferences and consent) and data controllers (with GDPR requirements) in order to support automated data transactions, accountability and transparency.
    \item [\textbf{O2.}] Design a policy matching algorithm that utilises the developed vocabularies to express data-sharing preferences, requests and agreements in decentralised personal datastores.
    \item [\textbf{O3.}] Design a service, using state of the art vocabularies, to assist with representing information connected with GDPRâ€™s data subject rights.
\end{enumerate}
