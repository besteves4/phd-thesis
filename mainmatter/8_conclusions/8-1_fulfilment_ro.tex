\section{Fulfilment of research objectives}
\label{sec:fulfilment}

In Section~\ref{sec:rqs}, the main research question driving the development of this Thesis is presented as 
\textit{``Are Semantic Web vocabularies and decentralised technologies able to support the exercising of data subject rights and determine the access conditions to personal data?''}
As such the following objective,
\textit{``Research methodologies and design vocabularies and services to aid EU data subjects in taking control of the movement of their personal data.''},
was identified to guide the Thesis development towards answering such question.
This objective was further divided into three sub-objectives and the extent of their fulfilment, based on the work presented in the previous Chapters and consolidated in the contributions outlined in Section~\ref{sec:contributions}, is discussed in this Section.

\paragraph{O1 -- Assist entities in the expression of data protection-related information:} The work developed in Chapter~\ref{chap:vocabularies}, in particular in Sections~\ref{sec:oac} and~\ref{sec:plasma}, and Chapters~\ref{chap:legal} and~\ref{chap:dga} targeted the fulfilment of this objective, with OAC and PLASMA targeting the expression of information legally aligned with the GDPR and DGAterms with the recently applicable DGA. Moreover, the developed Solid-based UIs for policy generation, SOPE (Section~\ref{sec:sope}) and SoDA (Section~\ref{sec:soda}), can assist users with expressing their policies using said vocabularies.

\paragraph{O2 -- Use machine-readable policies for accessing decentralised personal data:} The architecture and algorithms described in Chapter~\ref{chap:matching} targeted the achievement of this objective and, in particular, the proof of concept described in Section~\ref{sec:poc_health}, including the work on DUODRL, showcases its fulfilment for a health data sharing scenario.

\paragraph{O3 -- Aid the exercising of GDPRâ€™s data subject rights:} The work developed in Section~\ref{sec:rights_exercising}, on having machine-readable information related to the exercising of data subject rights with DPV, and in Section~\ref{sec:right-api}, on having a service to assist in the exercising and recording of such rights exercise activities, aimed to fulfil this goal. 

These results confirm the hypotheses drafted in Section~\ref{sec:hypotheses} as Semantic Web technologies can be used to successfully express data protection-related information, including the definition of data subject's privacy preferences as access control policies related to their personal data.
Furthermore, said technologies can be used to increase the transparency and accountability of decentralised data environments, in particular when it comes to the involved entities and infrastructure, including their access control mechanisms. 
By confirming such hypotheses, the work in this Thesis leaves data subjects one step closer to have control over the publication and movement of their personal data, and in return data controllers with a variety of tools to express information related with their GDPR duties.
