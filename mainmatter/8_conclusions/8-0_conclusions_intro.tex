\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chap:conclusions}

In a world where AI-based technologies are taking over and distrust in data-consuming services is at its highest point, BigTech companies prefer to deal with the consequences of their unlawful practices than provide the necessary tools to data subjects to make the right decisions over the processing of their personal data.
Endowed with enhanced interoperability and transparency features, the decentralised Semantic Web aims to aid data subjects in taking control of the publication and movement of their personal data.
As such, legally-aligned vocabularies and services were produced to support policy-based access to data in decentralised settings, providing accountability and enhanced transparency to people looking at regaining trust in Web services. 
To this end, Section~\ref{sec:fulfilment} concludes the Thesis with a discussion on the extent to which the research objectives have been fulfilled through the contributions described in Chapters~\ref{chap:vocabularies} to~\ref{chap:dga}.
Section~\ref{sec:future_work} provides lines of future work arising from the research presented within this Thesis.
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:impact} discusses the scientific, technological, and societal impact of the Thesis' contributions.
