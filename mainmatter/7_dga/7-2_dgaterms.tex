\section{Extending W3C vocabularies to cover DGA requirements}
\label{sec:extending_dga}

As an active contributor in the realm of data protection, the Semantic Web community possesses significant potential to aid with the compliance processes that such a legislation involve.
This potential is based on the opportunities for interoperability that such a Web of Linked Data can support.
In this context, Semantic Web technologies can be utilised:

\begin{itemize}
    \item to model conditions for the reuse of public data;
    \item by data subjects, data holders, and data users to declare data access and usage policies in a machine-readable format; and
    \item by organisations and service providers to fulfil their legal obligations such as maintaining records of the processing activities.
\end{itemize}

Hence, vocabularies like the DPV, ODRL, and DCAT play a pivotal role in these procedures, serving as interoperable frameworks for the expression of legally-aligned documentation.
DCAT and ODRL (including the work developed in OAC) can be used to publish records of activities as data catalogs and conditions for data access and usage as digital policies, respectively.
Meanwhile, DPV provides a comprehensive, openly accessible set of taxonomies for articulating machine-readable metadata regarding the handling and usage of personal data.
Using such solutions facilitates a transition from manual processes to automated ones by leveraging semantic technologies to uphold accuracy and scalability within the data-sharing ecosystems promoted by the DGA.
In the forthcoming Sections, terms from the previously mentioned standards and specifications are employed to represent some of the information items delineated in Section~\ref{sec:dga_flows}.
Additionally, the terms that cannot be expressed with existing vocabularies are provided in an open-source ad-hoc vocabulary -- DGAterms.
Examples to illustrate the practical applicability of the existing and developed semantic vocabularies are also supplied.

\subsection{Policies for the reuse and sharing of public data}
\label{sec:dga_policies}

In Section~\ref{sec:reuse}, it is highlighted that public sector bodies must provide single information point providers with details on their data resources and conditions for their re-usage.
This enables the providers to compile and maintain a searchable data asset list, facilitating data users' search and request for datasets for reuse.
Table~\ref{tab:conditions_public_data_vocabs} presents terms from DPV, DCAT, OAC, and DCMI Metadata Terms that can be repurposed to model some of the concepts identified in Table~\ref{tab:conditions_public_data}.

\begin{table}[ht] 
\centering
\caption{Information items that need to be represented to detail policies concerning the conditions of reuse of public sector bodies' datasets and respective reusable concepts from existing vocabularies.}
\label{tab:conditions_public_data_vocabs}
\begin{tabular}{c||l|l}
\textbf{Article} & \textbf{Information items} &\textbf{Terms from existing vocabularies} \\ \hline\hline
5.1 & Public sector body information & \texttt{dpv:hasName}, \texttt{dpv:hasContact} \\ \hline
5.1 & Competent body information & \texttt{dpv:hasName}, \texttt{dpv:hasContact} \\ \hline
5.2 & Categories of data & \texttt{dpv:hasData}, \texttt{dpv:Data} \\ \hline
5.2 & Purposes for usage and access & \texttt{dpv:hasPurpose}, \texttt{oac:Purpose} \\ \hline
5.3(a) & Nature of data & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}\texttt{dpv:hasData}, \texttt{dpv:AnonymisedData},\\ \texttt{dpv:PseudonymisedData}\end{tabular} \\ \hline
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}5.3(b),\\5.3(c)\end{tabular} & Processing environment & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}\texttt{dpv:ProcessingContext},\\ \texttt{dpv:hasLocation}\\ \texttt{dpv:WithinVirtualEnvironment}, \\ \texttt{dpv:WithinPhysicalEnvironment}\end{tabular} \\ \hline

8.2 & Data format & \texttt{dcat:mediaType}, \texttt{dcterms:format}\\ \hline
8.2 & Data size & \texttt{dcterms:extent} \\          
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Expanding upon the existing \texttt{dpv:LegalEntity} term, four new classes of entities were introduced in DGAterms, as subclasses, to represent data users, public sector bodies, competent bodies, and single information point providers.
These classes are named \texttt{DataUser}, \texttt{PublicSectorBody}, \texttt{DataReuseCompetentBody}, and \texttt{SingleInformationPointProvider}, respectively.
Additionally, subclasses of \texttt{SingleInformationPointProvider} were created to represent EU, national, regional, local, and sectorial-level single information point providers, as outlined in DGA's Article 8~\citeyearpar{noauthor_regulation_2022}.
Furthermore, to classify the nature of data kept by public sector bodies, as detailed in Article 3.1~\citeyearpar{noauthor_regulation_2022}, four new subclasses of texttt{dpv:Data} -- \texttt{ConfidentialData}, \texttt{CommerciallyConfidentialData}, \texttt{StatisticallyConfidentialData} and \texttt{IntellectualPropertyData} -- were modelled in DGAterms as well.
These subclasses represent data protected through \texttt{CommercialConfidentialityAgreement}s or \texttt{StatisticalConfidentialityAgreement}s, as well as data protected by intellectual property rights.

Beyond the aforementioned additions, the following concepts were included in the DGAterms vocabulary:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{A5-9} for permissions to transfer, \texttt{A5-11} for model contractual clauses, and \texttt{A5-12} for adequacy decisions were added as subclasses of \texttt{dpv:DataTransferLegalBasis}.
    \item \texttt{DataReusePolicy}, \texttt{DataTransferNotice} and \texttt{ThirdCountryDataRequestNotice} concepts were introduced as subclasses of DPV's policy and notice concepts. These represent the conditions for data reuse and the notice provided to data owners.
    \item \texttt{DataAssetList} and \texttt{DataReuseRequestProcedure} were modelled as subclasses of \texttt{dpv:OrganisationalMeasure} to represent the searchable asset list maintained by \texttt{SingleInformationPointProvider}s and the procedure to request datasets, respectively.
\end{itemize}

To illustrate the application of both established and newly introduced terms, an instance of a \texttt{DataReusePolicy} concerning the dataset located at \url{http://example.com/dataset_001} is presented in Listing~\ref{list:public_sector_body}.
This policy delineates the terms of usage for the dataset, specifying that it can be reused until the end of 2024, more specifically for the purpose of \texttt{ScientificResearch}.
It is noteworthy that this policy, structured as an ODRL offer, outlines the conditions for utilising the dataset without granting any privileges to the data user.
Single information point providers can utilise this policy to maintain an updated catalog of available assets along with their respective usage conditions.
Furthermore, Listing~\ref{list:data_asset_list} offers an example of a \texttt{DataAssetList} produced by a \texttt{SingleInformationPointProvider}, employing both pre-existing and newly devised terms.
This list includes the aforementioned dataset, \url{http://example.com/dataset_001}, supplemented with additional metadata encompassing its data type, the governing policy (\url{http://example.com/offer_publicsectorbody}), data format and size, and any associated fees charged by the dataset publisher.

\subsection{Querying DGA-mandated public registers}
\label{sec:dga_registers}

As outlined in Section~\ref{sec:registers}, data intermediation service providers and data altruism organisations are required to provide detailed information about the purpose of their operations to a public register dedicated to such entities. 
This facilitates the creation of a database comprising information about these entities, which can be accessed by data users, holders, or subjects for retrieving or publishing data, e.g., for altruistic endeavors.

From the information items that need to be represented in a public register of data intermediation service providers, as specified in Table~\ref{tab:registers_intermediation}, 7 out of 14 can be defined using DPV, DCAT, and DCMI Metadata Terms declared in Table~\ref{tab:querying_registers}.
In addition, from the 15 identified items that are necessary for a data intermediary to provide such service, 7 can also be described with DPV, DCAT, and DCMI Metadata Terms declared in Table~\ref{tab:querying_registers}.

\begin{table}[htp]

\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

As for the data altruism organisations, from the information items that need to be represented in a public register of such organisations, as specified in Table~\ref{tab:registers_altruism}, 5 out of 9 can be defined using the DPV and DCAT terms declared in Table~\ref{tab:querying_registers_b}.
In addition, from the 11 identified items which are necessary for a data altruism organisation to keep records of its activity, 5 can also be described with the DPV and DCMI Metadata Terms declared in Table~\ref{tab:querying_registers_b}.

\begin{table}[ht]

\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

In addition to these terms that can be reused from existing standards and specifications, DGAterms models the \texttt{DataIntermediationServiceProvider} concept to specify a data intermediation service provider (as a subclass of \texttt{dpv:LegalEntity}), and three new classes of entities to represent distinct types of intermediaries, i.e., \texttt{DataCooperativeServiceProvider}, \texttt{DataIntermediationServiceProviderForDataHolder}, and \texttt{DataIntermediationServiceProviderForDataSubject}.
The \texttt{DataAltruismOrganisation} concept is also introduced in DGAterms as a subclass of \texttt{dpv:NonProfitOrganisation}.
% Additionally, to be able to classify the nature of the entity, as specified in Article 11.6(b)~\citeyearpar{noauthor_regulation_2022}, five new properties were added to the vocabulary, \texttt{hasLegalStatus}, \texttt{hasForm}, \texttt{hasOwnershipStructure}, \texttt{hasSubsidiary}, and \texttt{hasRegistrationNumber}, to represent information regarding the legal status, form, ownership structure, subsidiary and registration number of an entity, respectively.
Details concerning the nature of the entity, as outlined in Article 11.6(b)~\citeyearpar{noauthor_regulation_2022} regarding its legal status, form, ownership structure, subsidiary relationships, and registration number, fall beyond the scope of DGAterms as they pertain to organisational-specific items.
However, as future work, upper ontologies like GIST \citeyearpar{semantic_arts_gist} or Schema.org \citep{guha_schemaorg_2015} can be examined and potentially extended to encompass these concepts if deemed necessary.
Moreover, a \texttt{PublicRegister} class was also modelled, as a new subclass of DPV's organisational measures, and its respective subclasses \texttt{PublicRegisterOfDataIntermediationServiceProviders} and \texttt{PublicRegisterOfDataAltruismOrganisations} to represent public registers of data intermediaries and altruistic organisations, respectively.

An illustration of a register of data intermediation service providers, incorporating both existing and newly introduced terms, is available in Listing~\ref{list:intermediary_register}.
The register \texttt{ex:publicregistry\_DI\_PT} presents a comprehensive list of intermediaries operating in Portugal.
In addition to storing metadata concerning the national authority \texttt{ex:nationalauthority\_PT} and creation dates, the register already includes a registered company, \texttt{ex:DISP\_Y}, which operates as a \texttt{DataCooperative}.
DPV's \texttt{hasName}, \texttt{hasContact}, and \texttt{hasAddress}, along with DCAT's \texttt{landingPage}, are used to detail the providers offering data intermediation services.
On the other hand, DCMI's \texttt{description}, \texttt{created}, and \texttt{publisher} predicates are essential in describing metadata pertaining to the register itself.

\begin{listing}[ht]

\end{minted}
\end{listing}

Storing the public registers in RDF format, utilising existing and crafted semantic vocabularies such as DGAterms, facilitates seamless querying of these structures, using a language like SPARQL, for automated retrieval of information concerning data intermediation service providers (or of data altruism organisations).
An example query targeting data cooperatives is presented in Listing~\ref{list:cooperatives_sparql}, which returns the providers offering such services, along with their names and public websites.

\begin{listing}[ht]
\caption{SPARQL query to retrieve data cooperatives.}
\label{list:cooperatives_sparql}
\begin{minted}{sparql}
SELECT DISTINCT ?Provider ?Name ?Web WHERE {
    ?Provider a dgaterms:DataCooperative .
    ?Provider dpv:hasName ?Name .
    ?Provider dcat:landingPage ?Web . }
\end{minted}
\end{listing}

Furthermore, beyond public registers, as mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:registers}, intermediaries and altruism organisations must keep records of their respective activities for the competent authorities to verify their compliance with DGA-mandated requirements for providing such services.
In Listing~\ref{list:activity_log}, a representation of a record of data altruism activity is presented, using the modelled \texttt{RecordOfDataIAltruismActivity}.
These activity logs should be linked with the entities utilising the data and can be documented utilising DPV's \texttt{hasPersonalDataHandling}. 
This property can be used to supply details regarding the data processing, encompassing aspects such as duration, purpose, and categories of (personal) data involved.

\subsection{Uniform data altruism forms}
\label{sec:dga_forms}

As demonstrated by the examples presented in the preceding Sections, the identified vocabularies, along with the one developed in this Chapter, are suitable for automating the generation of compliance documentation for single information point providers, data altruism organisations, and data intermediation service providers alike.
Following these steps, the representation of consent forms for data subjects and permission forms for data holders should also be possible to automate with such technologies.
Through their (re)use, the DGA-mandated European data altruism forms can be ensured to be interoperable across the EU.
An instance of a consent form, utilising the DGAterms-modelled \texttt{EuropeanDataAltruismConsentForm}, completed by a data subject, is detailed in Listing~\ref{list:european_form_ds}.
In this example, an altruistic purpose for processing is used.
To this end, a taxonomy of \texttt{DataAltruism} concepts, modelled from DGA's Article 2.16~\citeyearpar{noauthor_regulation_2022}, are presented in DGAterms, with seven new purposes applicable to a data altruism context: \texttt{ImproveHealthcare}, \texttt{CombatClimateChange}, \texttt{ImproveTransportMobility} (utilised in Listing~\ref{list:european_form_ds}), \texttt{ProvideOfficialStatistics}, \texttt{ImprovePublicServices}, \texttt{ScientificResearch}, and \texttt{PublicPolicyMaking}.
Furthermore, additional purposes referenced throughout the DGA are also incorporated into the vocabulary developed in this Chapter.

\begin{listing}[ht]
\caption{Data altruism consent form, where the data subject consents to the usage of their location data for improving mobility.}
\label{list:european_form_ds}
\begin{minted}{turtle}

            dpv:hasName "Company A" ] ] .
\end{minted}
\end{listing}

Similarly, Listing~\ref{list:european_form_dh} presents an example of a permission form issued by a data holder.

\subsection{DGAterms development and evaluation}

The methodology followed to produce the vocabulary is described in Section~\ref{sec:ontology_engineering}.
The vocabulary human-readable documentation and machine-readable file are available at \url{https://w3id.org/dgaterms} using content negotiation.
The HTML documentation includes a description of the terms defined in DGAterms, which was conducted and validated with domain experts, diagrams with graphical representations of the several taxonomies included in the vocabulary, RDF examples of policies, registers of entities, and records of activities that use DGAterms terms.
The vocabulary documentation also includes metadata, such as the identity of the creators and publishers of the vocabulary, the dates of creation and last modification, or the version number.

The source code is hosted at \url{https://w3id.org/dgaterms/repo}, under the CC-BY-4.0 license.
The repository can also be used by DGAterms implementers to suggest new inclusions to the vocabulary and to report bugs through GitHub Issues.

In terms of quality evaluation, the OOPS! tool was used to detect common errors in ontology development, such as missing domain or range properties or missing human-readable annotations.
No critical nor important issues were detected through this evaluation.
Moreover, FOOPS! was used to evaluate the alignment of the developed vocabularies with the FAIR principles.
The following results were obtained:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Findable -- 8/9
    \item Accessible -- 2/3
    \item Interoperable -- 2/3
    \item Reusable -- 8.83/9
    \item FOOPS! overall score -- 91\%
\end{itemize}
% TODO: perform evaluation
These outcomes are aligned with the scores obtained for OAC, PLASMA, and DUODRL.
% and largely exceed the ones computed for DUO (Findable -- 4.50/9; Accessible -- 2/3; Interoperable -- 3/3; Reusable -- 3.50/9; FOOPS! overall score -- 54\%).
Furthermore, DGAterms obtained a good score in all FAIR aspects.
In terms of improvements, DGAterms can be submitted to LOV to be recorded in a public registry of ontologies.
This will improve both the findability and the accessibility of the vocabulary.
