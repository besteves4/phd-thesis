A new series of regulations concerning the usage and management of data is currently under consideration for adoption across the EU countries.
Within this framework, the Data Governance Act (DGA) \citeyearpar{noauthor_regulation_2022}, a regulation primarily focused on regulating the operations of data intermediation services and data altruism organisations, was approved by the Commission in May 2022 and is now mandated for implementation in all EU member states.
This Chapter outlines a range of requirements outlined by the DGA aimed at safeguarding the interests of both data subjects and data holders -- a new legal role inserted in the DGA to refer to entities providing non-personal data --, as well as regulating the jurisdiction of relevant authorities. 
Additionally, it presents various scenarios where the application of Semantic Web technologies, such as the developed work on OAC, ODRL, and DPV, could assist these stakeholders in meeting their respective new rights and responsibilities.

% This Chapter discusses the legal and ethical challenges of the impact of data-driven innovation in society, in particular, related to the emergence of PIMS as a service that helps individuals have more control over the processing of their data.
% While some studies have recently been published on the intersection of Solid and data protection requirements, as reviewed in Section~\ref{sec:sota_solid_data_protection}, plenty still has to be overcome to have a `legally-aligned' personal datastore.
% This interdisciplinary discussion relies on the collaborations fostered through the PROTECT project, and other EU-funded projects described in Section~\ref{sec:projects}, as well as through the participation in the W3C DPVCG work with data protection law experts.
% 
% Section~\ref{sec:motivation_legal} describes the emergence of decentralised personal information management systems as a way to give users more control over their personal data and the challenges that still need to be overcome in order to have to a GDPR-aligned personal datastore.
% 
% Section~\ref{sec:policies_consent} discusses the usage of OAC policies as a precursor of consent for Solid, which can enable compliance with several GDPR requirements including the transparent information obligations of Articles 13 and 14 and the conditions to obtain valid consent pursuant to Articles 4.11 and 7.
% 
% Section~\ref{sec:automation_consent} argues whether the automation of consent can be performed while maintaining the `informed', `freely given', `specific', and `unambiguous' character of GDPR consent.
% In particular, the specificity of purposes and processing operations, the distinction between data controllers and recipients, the compatibility of purposes, and the delegation of consent are further analysed through a `legal+tech' approach, relying on GDPR's requirements and on the OAC and PLASMA implementations.
% 
% Section~\ref{sec:biomedical_exception} discusses the special requirements of GDPR's special categories of data and research-related exceptions and, in particular, the requirements related to the sharing of health data for biomedical research or for the management of public health.
% 
% To conclude, Section~\ref{sec:ethical_challenges} debates the ethical challenges of controlling data and reclaiming control over it and explores how decentralised PIMS can help build confidence in data exchange practices and trust in the providers and developers of such systems.
