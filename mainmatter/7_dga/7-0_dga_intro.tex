After witnessing the influence of the GDPR on managing the personal data of European citizens, the European Commission has shifted its attention to establishing a unified data strategy.
This strategy aims to encourage the (re)use and exchange of data among citizens, businesses, and governments, all while ensuring control remains with the original data generators \citep{european_commission_communication_2020}.
In this context, a new series of regulations concerning the usage and management of data is currently under consideration for adoption across the EU countries.
Within this framework, the Data Governance Act (DGA) \citeyearpar{noauthor_regulation_2022}, a regulation primarily focused on regulating the operations of data intermediation services and data altruism organisations, was approved by the Commission in May 2022 and is now mandated for implementation in all EU member states.

This Chapter outlines a range of requirements outlined by the DGA aimed at safeguarding the interests of both data subjects and data holders -- a new legal role inserted in the DGA to refer to entities providing non-personal data --, as well as regulating the jurisdiction of relevant authorities. 
Additionally, it presents various scenarios where the application of Semantic Web technologies, such as the developed work on OAC, ODRL, and DPV, could assist these stakeholders in meeting their respective new rights and responsibilities.
More specifically, it aims to achieve three main goals: (i) generating machine-readable policies for the reuse of public data, (ii) defining consent and permission terms for data altruism, and (iii) establishing standardised registers of data altruism organisations and intermediation service providers and records of their activities.
By leveraging these semantic vocabularies, the aim is not only to enhance machine-readability and interoperability but also to streamline the modelling of data-sharing policies and consent forms across various scenarios, as well as facilitating the creation of a shared semantic framework for maintaining public registers of data intermediaries and altruism organisations, along with documenting their activities.
Given the accessibility and extensibility of these vocabularies, adapting them to meet specific requirements outlined in the DGA becomes a straightforward task.
The prefixes and namespaces used in the Listings in this Chapter are explicitly defined in the \hyperref[sec:namespaces]{Namespaces list}.

Section~\ref{sec:dga_flows} provides a description of the DGA and the entities within it, as well as the identification of flows of information between entities.
Moreover, three scenarios where Semantic Web technologies can be leveraged to assist data subjects and data holders in establishing the conditions for the reuse of their data, and public sector bodies, data intermediaries and altruistic organisations in fulfilling their DGA-related obligations. 

Section~\ref{sec:extending_dga} discusses the usage of ODRL, DPV, DCAT and  other vocabularies to express policies for the reuse and sharing of public sector body-held data, to represent registers of entities and logs of their activities, and to create uniform data altruism forms to record consent actions of data subjects and permissions of data holders.

Section~\ref{sec:soda} describes the development of a Solid Data Altruism application, to implement data altruism as a service using Solid and ODRL policies to grant access to personal data for altruistic purposes in a privacy-friendly manner.

To conclude, Section~\ref{sec:lessons} debates the advantages and challenges of the proposed semantic model towards having semantic interoperability to support the development of common European data spaces.
