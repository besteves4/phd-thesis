\section{Gaps and challenges}
\label{sec:challenges}

This Section discusses the challenges of having a transparent, legally-aligned Solid ecosystem based on the literature review described in this Chapter. The following issues were identified based on the performed analysis:

\begin{enumerate} % copy from PLASMA paper
    \item [Ch1.] \textbf{Identity of Solid actors and their roles is unknown} -- Solid users are unaware of who are the entities providing and/or developing their Pods, the apps they use, WebIDs, or server infrastructure and implementation. Furthermore, most apps or services do not provide contact details or information regarding their data protection officer.
    \item [Ch2.] \textbf{No metadata about Solid infrastructure} -- Solid users do not have information on which Solid specification their Pod is running, which functionalities are installed within it or where are the servers located. Moreover, no record of this information is kept in the Pod for easy consultation by the user.\footnote{A non-exhaustive list of Pod providers is available at \url{https://solidproject.org/users/get-a-pod}, with information on the service used to host the Pods (but no information on the entities behind them) and, in some cases, the country where it is hosted (but no privacy policy for the storage service is provided).}
    \item [Ch3.] \textbf{Availability/Discovery of categories of data} -- To have granular access to data in Pods, based on their data category, Solid apps need to know if they exist and where are they stored in the Pod. Moreover, for seamless interoperability, schemas, formats or shapes for data recognised or supported by apps, services or Pods need to be recorded.
    \item [Ch4.] \textbf{Pod and app providers do not provide information on their data handling practices} -- Most providers and developers of Pod-related services do not provide human and/or machine-readable privacy notices nor do they declare what data they need to function. Such information also needs to be recorded in the Pod so that users can have a copy of the user/app request for data, e.g., in case data is used in a way that was not permitted by its data subject.
    \item [Ch5.] \textbf{Users cannot express their privacy policies} -- Solid users do not have the tools to express their privacy preferences and requirements nor to manage incoming data requests or existing decisions for the usage of data.
    \item [Ch6.] \textbf{No logging or record-keeping} -- No provenance metadata is recorded for accountability in the user Pod, e.g., users do not keep consent records, nor information regarding who has accessed their data, what they are doing with it, or changes to their data handling policies.
    \item [Ch7.] \textbf{No legal compliance checks} -- Solid does not provide its users with the tools to deal with legal requirements, such as giving/withdrawing consent or exercising rights under the GDPR, nor does it provide authorities with the auditing information to perform investigations.
