This Chapter presents the state of the art on the representation of policies and personal data processing metadata in the context of determining access to decentralised personal data systems, focusing on solutions that use Semantic Web technologies and cater to data protection law requirements.
Since there are different areas being covered in this state of the art analysis, each topic will be first introduced with a list of criteria used to perform said analysis. 

Thus, a literature review was performed in the subsequent areas, following the methodology described in Section \ref{sec:technical_review}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [\textbf{\ref{sec:sota_solid}}] Decentralising the access to personal data with Solid
    \item [\textbf{\ref{sec:sota_vocabularies}}] Representing personal data processing information
    \item [\textbf{\ref{sec:sota_policies}}] Using policy languages to specify access control conditions
\end{itemize}

Through this analysis, a series of gaps and challenges in the representation of privacy terms was identified, in order to have a legally-aligned Solid environment, and is described in Section \ref{sec:challenges}.
